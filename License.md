This is a free-for-all source code. You can do whatever you want with it without having to ask me for permission. I'd be happy if you let 
me know that this helps you, but that is of course strictly optional.
The source code is also provided as-is, which means you can't blame me under any circumstances if the code has bug(s) and those bugs cause 
damage to you.
